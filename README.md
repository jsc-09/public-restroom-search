# The Restroom Hunters

## Overview

```
WE wanted to create an app that 
YOU can rely on in those special times 
WHEN nature calls to quickly find facilities that will meet 
YOUR specific needs
SO we bring to you Restroom Hunter!
```

## User Story

```
AS an urban, suburban, and rural explorer
I NEED to locate restrooms frequently, and more times than not, quickly
SO THAT I can always have a back up plan when nature calls
```

## Functionality

```
GIVEN a restroom dashboard with search input
WHEN I am prompted for my location
THEN I am presented with restrrom locations, and if needed I can sort by special needs
WHEN I view the nearest locations
THEN I am presented with the location name, the address, an icon representation of ADA, unisex, and restrooms with a baby changing station
```

## Mock Up
